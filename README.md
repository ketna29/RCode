Life history evolution of Orca (Predictive analysis &amp; Statistics)

Getting inspiration from the Ecological Theory invoked a great interest into simulating a very interesting species as The Killer Whale. Living deep into the oceans, this species is getting rare and simulating their life and reproductive life cycle can give us a good statistical data to predict their existence and population in the coming years depending upon their survival and environmental factors. Living in the real world and being unaware of the marine life, such simulations give an idea of what is going on in the life cycle of a certain species.

This simulation assignment also allows and motivate us to simulate any other species around the world with similar methods which is very important for the scientists who are working in Ecology and also beneficial to these creatures which can be helped by us humans. If we can simulate their life and reproductive cycles under different scenarios then we can be able to predict what is endangering that species and what further steps can be taken for their survival especially for a species that is very close to extinction.

The main goal of is to simulate the reproductive life histories of thousands of female killer whales and to investigate how the availability and variability of resources affects individual fitness. In addition to that, we will also find out the total reproductive output and the age of females at death under different environmental conditions.
